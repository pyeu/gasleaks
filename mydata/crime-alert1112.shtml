<p><i><b>Community Crime Alerts</B> are reports of major criminal incidents on the campus that could potentially affect the larger Stanford community.  While such crimes are not indicative of life on campus, it is important to be aware of them when they do occur and to take the appropriate precautions.</i></p>

<p><i>The following crime alerts were put out by the Stanford University Department of Public Safety during the academic year of 2011-2012.  Crime Alerts are listed according to the most recent incident.</i></p>

<h3><a name=""></a><u><i>Additional Information for</i> Sexual Battery, 9/19/12, 6:53 am</u></h3>

<p><i><b>From Palo Alto PD</i></b> -- Early this morning, a female jogger was able to free herself from a man who approached her from behind and bear-hugged her, grabbing her breast in the process and possibly trying to pull her down.  Police believe the suspect is likely the same person who has committed two recent sexual batteries in Palo Alto.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, September 19, 2012, at about 6:53 a.m., officers from the Palo Alto Police Department responded to the area of Palo Alto Avenue at Alma Street on a report of an assault that had just occurred.  The victim, a female in her 20s, was jogging southbound into Palo Alto from Menlo Park on the path through El Palo Alto Park at 102 Palo Alto Avenue.  An unknown male suspect approached her from behind, bear-hugged her, and grabbed one of her breasts.  The victim said she felt as though the suspect was trying to pull her down.  She screamed.  She was able to wriggle free from his grasp, and in the process, she fell to the ground.  The suspect immediately jogged away from her on the same path and headed southbound on the sidewalk of Alma Street.  The victim did not suffer any injuries.</p>

<p>The victim followed the suspect from a distance and used her cell phone to call the police.  She yelled after the suspect and told him she was notifying police.  She last saw the suspect jogging eastbound on Hawthorne Avenue from Alma Street.</p>

<p>Several officers and detectives from the Palo Alto Police Department responded to the area, as did a police canine unit from the Menlo Park Police Department.  Officers extensively checked the area with the police dog, but were unable to locate the suspect.</p>

<p>The victim described the suspect as possibly Middle Eastern or Hispanic, about 40 years of age.  He was about 5 feet 9 inches tall with a medium build.  The victim said he was dressed as though he too was out for a jog, as he was wearing a light gray long-sleeve shirt and dark gray or black running pants.  He had thin black hair.  As the victim was never able to see the details of the suspect's face, there is no sketch available for distribution.</p>

<p>This appears to be the third crime likely committed by the same suspect in Palo Alto in the past month.  On August 20, the suspect grabbed a womanâs buttocks in the 600 block of Fulton Street at about noon.  On August 29, the suspect grabbed a womanâs breast at the Stanford Shopping Center at about 12:13 p.m.  Sketches of the suspect from both of those cases have been previously released, and are available on our Facebook page at www.facebook.com/PaloAltoPolice.</p>  

<p>Investigators do not believe that a sexual battery that occurred on the Stanford University campus on September 12 is related to this series of incidents in Palo Alto, as the suspect description is different.</p>

<p>Detectives from the Palo Alto Police Department are actively investigating these incidents.  Any developments or any new suspect information will be released to the community in a timely manner.</p>

<p>"We are concerned about all of these events, but we are particularly concerned about this one, as it appears as though the suspectâs behavior may be escalating," said Lieutenant Zach Perron.  âWeâre going to do everything we can to identify and apprehend him.  We ask for the publicâs help with reporting suspicious behavior immediately to 9-1-1.â</p>

<p>While this has been the only case of a female jogger being targeted, we recommend that women jog in pairs or small groups whenever possible.  In every case, however, we strongly recommended that joggers not cover both ears with headphones, so as to be better aware of their surroundings and anyone who may be approaching them from behind.  We also recommend that joggers carry a cell phone with them, and stay in well-traveled areas whenever possible.</p>

<p>There are a number of good personal safety and crime prevention tips posted on the City of Palo Alto website.  Visit <a href="http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/StopCrime">www.cityofpaloalto.org/StopCrime</a> for more information.</p>

<p>We continue to recommend that you remain aware of your surroundings when out in public, and we encourage you to report suspicious behavior immediately via 9-1-1.  Anyone with information about this incident or the other recent sexual batteries is asked to call our 24-hour dispatch center at 650-329-2413.  Anonymous tips can be e-mailed to <a href="mailto:paloalto@tipnow.org?Subject=Alma%20Sexual%20Battery%20">paloalto@tipnow.org</a> or sent via text message or voice mail to 650-383-8984.</p>

<h3><a name=""></a><u>Sexual Battery, 9/19/12, 6:53 am</u></h3>

<p>A female reported that on Wednesday morning (9/19/12) at approximately 6:53 am, while running on south Alma and Palo Alto Ave (in Palo Alto), an unknown male suspect grabbed her breasts and then tried to pull her into the bushes.</p>

<h3><a name=""></a><u>9/7/12 Auto Burglars Strike Palo Alto Parking Lots and Parking Garages</u></h3>

<p><b>Palo Alto, CA</b> -- Officers from the Palo Alto Police Department have taken 17 auto burglary reports in the past two days. In all 17 vehicles, the windows were smashed and the suspects stole computer bags, laptops, electronic equipment and personal documents.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, September 5, 2012, there were a total of 11 reported auto burglaries. The suspects targeted vehicles clustered in the same location within a downtown parking lot or the Stanford Shopping Center parking lot.</p>

<p>At the Stanford Shopping Center, the suspects burglarized six vehicles within a ten minute time frame, from 8:00 â 8:10 p.m. All six vehicles were locked and parked in the same general area on the west side, along El Camino Real. In all of these cases, the suspect smashed a window, reached inside, and pulled the trunk release lever. The suspect then stole laptop bags containing computers and other personal items that were in the trunk.</p>

<p>At approximately 8:42 p.m., our 24-hour dispatch center received a report of an auto burglary in City Parking Garage âRâ at 528 High Street. Officers from the Palo Alto Police Department responded and discovered a total of four vehicles had been burglarized. The suspect smashed a window out in each vehicle and reached inside to retrieve laptop bags and brief cases containing computers, electronic items, and other personal documents. Items were taken from the interior compartment in three of the four burglaries. The suspect pulled the trunk release lever on the fourth vehicle and stole items from there.</p> 

<p>At 9:17 p.m., one final victim reported an auto burglary in City Parking Lot âHâ at 571 Cowper Street. Again, the suspect smashed a window and reached inside the main cabin to retrieve two laptop bags containing computers and personal items.</p> 

<p>On Thursday, September 6, 2012, there were a total of six reported auto burglaries reported from three separate downtown parking garages.</p>

<p>Between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. two auto burglaries occurred in City Parking Garage âRâ at 528 High Street. The suspect smashed a window in both cases. In one case, the suspect stole a backpack containing personal items that was in plain view. The suspect pulled the trunk release in the second vehicle and stole a laptop from the trunk.</p>

<p>Between the hours of 7:00 and 9:30 p.m., two auto burglaries occurred in City Parking Garage âSâ at 445 Bryant Street. The suspect smashed a window in each of the two vehicles and removed laptop bags that were in plain view.</p>

<p>The last two reported auto burglaries occurred between 7:30 and 9:45 p.m. in City Parking Garage âJâ at 520 Webster Street. Again, the suspect smashed a window out in each vehicle and removed a laptop bag and backpack that were in plain view.</p>

<p>Although a handful of the victim vehicles were rental cars, it does not appear that the suspect targeted any particular make or model. It appears as though the suspects could be targeting rental vehicles, perhaps with the thinking that business travelers often travel with personal electronic devices.</p>

<p>We recommend that you take your valuables with you whenever possible, or at the very least, secure them out of sight prior to arriving at your destination. Leaving valuables in plain view is a sure way to attract the attention of a burglar. Also, be sure to always lock your vehicle and close the windows when it is unattended. While that advice would not have helped the victims in these cases, having a locked vehicle will absolutely have a deterrent effect on some criminals. For more crime prevention tips, please visit our website at <a href="http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/StopCrime">www.cityofpaloalto.org/StopCrime</a>.</p>

<p>Officers and detectives from the Palo Alto Police Department are actively working this crime trend. Uniformed officers are increasing their patrols, and plainclothes detectives are also out looking for the suspects.</p>

<p>In a few of the cases, witnesses observed possible suspects. However, the possible suspect descriptions are so varied that the Palo Alto Police Department is not releasing any information about them at this time, and instead would like to ask people to focus on observing suspicious behavior, as opposed to looking for a particular description of person. Detectives believe that the 17 cases are likely related, and were committed by the same suspect or group of suspects.</p>

<p>We encourage people to call 9-1-1 to report suspicious behavior, and allow the police to investigate if that behavior is innocent or criminal. It is always better to call and let the police do their job, rather than rationalize suspicious behavior and not call. For example, people loitering in parking lots and peering into cars or trying door handles is absolutely suspicious behavior, and merits a 9-1-1 call right away. Anyone with information about these auto burglaries is asked to call our 24-hour dispatch center at 650-329-2413. Anonymous tips can be e-mailed to paloalto@tipnow.org or sent via text message or voice mail to 650-383-8984.</p>

<h3><a name=""></a><u>8/29/12 Sexual Battery Occurs at Stanford Shopping Center</u></h3>

<p><p><b>Palo Alto, CA</b> -- A man approached a woman in the parking lot of Stanford Shopping
Center this afternoon, grabbed one of her breasts over her clothes, and fled on foot.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, August 29, 2012, at about 12:13 p.m., officers from the Palo Alto Police
Department responded to the Stanford Shopping Center at 180 El Camino Real on a report
of a sexual battery that had just occurred. The victim, a female in her 30s, was walking
eastbound on the sidewalk of Orchard Lane between Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus. An
unknown male suspect stepped out in front of her from between two parked cars and used
his hand to grab one of the victimâs breasts over her clothing. The suspect then ran away
and was last seen in a parking lot along Welch Road. The victim immediately called 9-1-1
from her cell phone. Officers and detectives from the Palo Alto Police Department,
assisted by deputies from the Stanford Department of Public Safety, conducted an
extensive search but could not find the suspect. The victim was not injured.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/SexualBattery_Sus_082912.jpg" /></p>

<p>The victim described the suspect as an East Indian male, about 30 years of age. He was
wearing a yellow hooded sweatshirt with the hood up over his head. The victim said he
was about 5 feet 9 inches tall with a medium build. A sketch of the suspect is attached to
this press release.</p>

<p>There was a similar sexual battery reported to us last week. The press release and sketch
from that case are attached here for reference. Detectives are actively investigating these
cases, and believe it is likely the same suspect may be responsible for both crimes. Patrol
officers and plainclothes detectives will be on the lookout for the suspect in the meantime.</p>

 <h3><a name="spring12"></a><u>Community Advisory</u></h3>
 
<p>This community advisory is to call your attention to two separate thefts of catalytic converters 
	removed from vehicles parked on campus. The first theft occurred on May 17th on the 100 
	block of Campus Drive and the second on May 26th  on Olmsted Road at Hoskins Court.  Both vehicles 
	were SUVs which is the most common type of vehicle targeted as they sit higher off the ground 
making it easier and quicker to remove the converter from underneath.  </p> 
<p>Thefts of catalytic converters are an area-wide concern.  The price paid on the black market 
	or by unsuspecting automobile repair or parts shops can be in the hundreds of dollars making 
the catalytic converter an attractive target of thieves.  </p>
<p>To help prevent the theft of your converter, especially if you own an SUV, the Stanford University 
Department of Public Safety recommends you take the following precautions:    </p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, park your vehicle in a well lit and visible location.  
<li>When at home, park your vehicle in the garage.  If no garage is available, park it in the driveway and leave 
	on any outside light(s) that will illuminate the vehicle (e.g. motion light).  
<li>Be observant for suspicious activities in and around areas where vehicles are parked such as 
	neighborhoods, parking lots, and parking structures.  One example might be an individual who is 
	underneath a vehicle with another who appears to be acting as a lookout.
<li>As with any crime or suspicious activity, the Department of Public Safety urges you to immediately 
	call your local law enforcement agency by dialing 9-1-1.  If on campus, you can also call 9-911 from 
	a campus phone.
