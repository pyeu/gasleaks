<h3><a name=""></a><u>Attempted Burglary</u></h3>

<p>On 4/9/16 a residential attempted burglary occurred in the 700 block of Mayfield Dr. around 7:45PM. The unknown suspect attempted to gain entry by prying the door frame and was unsuccessful. The suspect then attempted to gain entry by throwing a rock through the window. At this point an occupant of the home went towards the sound and noticed the broken window. Shortly thereafter a vehicle was heard leaving the area. No one was seen and there is no vehicle description at this time.</p>

<p>The Stanford police encourage individuals to keep their doors and windows locked. Additionally, we ask the community to report suspicious and criminal activity to the police as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Anyone with additional information should contact the Stanford Police at 650-329-2413.</p>

<p>Additional information, will be posted on

 <h2><a name=""></a><u>Tax Fraud and Identity Theft Notice</u></h2>
<p>In light of several reported incidents of tax returns that were fraudulently filed in the names of Stanford community members, the Department of Public Safety and the Information Security Office would like to make you aware of an IRS campaign aimed at preventing this crime, which is on the rise throughout the country.  The campaign known as Taxes, Security, Together is a âa joint effort between the IRS, states, and the private-sector tax industry. The collaboration is designed to raise taxpayer awareness about taking simple steps on the Internet and their personal devices to protect the safety of their financial and tax data. The education campaign complements the expanded series of important new protections the IRS, states, and tax industry put in place for the 2016 filing season to address tax-related identity theft.â   The following link to the campaign also provides important information on the various tax frauds and scams, preventive measures, and several resources to help protect your identity and credit:
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Taxes-Security-Together"> https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Taxes-Security-Together </a></p>
<p>Additionally, the Information Security Office provides specific guidance to the Stanford community on how to avoid, detect, and handle identity theft at:
<a href="https://security.stanford.edu/identity-theft"> https://security.stanford.edu/identity-theft </a></p> 
<p>If you are a victim of a tax fraud, scam, or identity theft, please report it to the Department of Public Safety at (650) 329-2413 (24/7).</p>
<p>Once a police report is filed, you can contact the Identity Theft Council, which provides victims with FREE support and credit recovery assistance, by dialing (888) 771-0767.

<h3><a name=""></a><u>Community Alert- Recent Thefts</u></h3>

<p>There have been numerous burglaries and thefts reported to the Stanford 
Department of Public Safety (SUDPS) over recent weeks. In most cases, 
laptop computers have been stolen. The incidents have occurred in 
offices, research facilities and student residences throughout campus. 
The suspect (or suspects) may be posing as university employees in order 
to avoid detection.</p>

<p>To help prevent theft, SUDPS recommends individuals take the following 
measures:</p>

<p>Be attentive to your surroundings. If there are persons unfamiliar to 
you in places where individuals without a legitimate business purpose 
should not be located, have a plan for monitoring the individual's 
movements. Be prepared to call 9-1-1 to report suspicious activity.</p>

<p>Lock doors and windows, even if you will only be away for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Store valuable in a locked cabinet or drawer.</p>

<p>Consider purchasing a locked device for portable items such as laptop 
computers.</p>

<p>Make sure university electronic equipment such as laptops and mobile 
phones is properly encrypted.</p>

 <h3><a name=""></a><u>Sexual Battery 1-16-2016</u></h3>

<p>January 1-16-2016: Reported Sexual Battery at a Main Quad restroom, 8 pm.  The suspect was described as a white male adult about 6 feet tall with a full beard.  He was wearing a red Stanford hoodie sweatshirt with black Stanford sweatpants and white shoes.  He appeared to be in his early 20's.  Be alert & protect yourself.  Updates when available at emergency.stanford.edu </p>
<p></p>
<p>Stanford University does not tolerate sexual assault, sexual misconduct or sexual harassment. The university encourages anyone who has been sexually assaulted or subject to other forms of sexual misconduct or harassment to report the incident to university officials. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The information about this incident is being reported to you in accordance with the Clery Act. The remainder of this email provides information about preventing and reporting sexual assault. </p>
<ul>
<li>Ignorance of the law or of university policy concerning sexual assault, sexual  misconduct and sexual harassment is not a defense.
<li>Receive affirmative consent from your partner before engaging in sexual activity.
<li>Perpetrators may attempt to use alcohol to facilitate a sexual assault. Statistically, the majority of reported sexual  assaults occur while one or both parties are under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  Alcohol or drugs may impair one's ability to judge whether or not consent has been given, but it is never an excuse for choosing to violate another person.
<li>There are a number of drugs that may be added to beverages with the intent of altering the consciousness or incapacitating a person without their knowledge. These drugs are particularly dangerous when combined with alcohol and often produce amnesia, leaving a victim unclear about what occurred afterward. These drugs can facilitate criminal activity, most often acts of sexual misconduct or sexual assault.
</ul>
<p>If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, or if you aren't sure whether you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, there are a number of resources available to you at Stanford to inform you of your options and to support you in whatever path you choose to take in addressing the incident.

<h3><a name="winter16"></a><u>Thefts From Vehicles</u></h3>

<p>This Community Alert is to notify the Stanford community that there has been a recent spike in thefts from vehicles. The thefts have occurred at various locations and times on campus. Several of these thefts have occurred from vehicles parked at Nixon Elementary School after school hours and on weekends. The method of entry into the vehicles has been through unlocked doors or by smashing a window. To help avoid becoming a victim, the Stanford University Department of Public Safety (SUDPS) is encouraging individuals to follow a few simple practices:</p>

<p>- Do not leave valuables exposed inside a vehicle, including shopping bags with the store name or logo printed on the side. You should take them with you or secure them in the trunk.</p>

<p>- LOCK the doors and roll up the windows whenever you will be away from your vehicle. </p>

<p>- If your vehicle is equipped with an alarm system, activate it each time you leave the vehicle unattended.</p>

<p>- Park in lighted and visible parking lots and streets, when possible.</p>

<p>- Avoid parking next to or between larger vehicles than yours that can provide concealment for a thief (vans, SUVs, trucks).</p>

<p>- Most importantly, dial 9-1-1 immediately if you observe any suspicious activity or behavior (e.g. an individual loitering around vehicles, peering into vehicles, and/or trying door handles), or if you are a victim of a theft.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, concerns, or would like additional information on crime prevention, please call SUDPS at (650) 723-9633 (M-F, 8am to 5pm) or email us at police@stanford.edu. </p>

 <h3><a name=""></a><u>Online Blackmail Scam</u></h3>

<p>The Department of Public Safety has been made aware of fraudulent online activity impacting individuals at Stanford. As a result, campus police are warning users of internet-based video chat programs (such as Skype) about an online blackmail scam.</p>

<p>To carry out the scam, the offender contacted the individual victims on a social networking site using an assumed identity.  After establishing a relationship, the offender convinced the  victims to engage in intimate acts which the victims believed were taking place in a private video chat session. Unbeknownst to the individual victims, the victim's actions were recorded by the suspect.  Later, the offender blackmailed the individual victims with the threat of releasing the recorded footage to their social media contacts unless payment was made (usually via a wire transfer).  The suspect(s) did send the recorded material of at least one of the victims to others without the victim's consent.</p>

<p>To avoid becoming a victim, we recommend the following:</p>

<p>- Refrain from video chatting (e.g. webcam) with, or sending photos or videos to, anyone whom you do not know and trust.</p>

<p>- Assume any private video footage or images you transmit over the internet could become public without your knowledge or consent.</p>

<p>- Set social media preferences to private, including your contact list.</p>

<p>- Make sure that your software and systems are up-to-date and that you are using up-to-date security software.
Be aware that anything you do on the internet, including video and voice calls, can be recorded.</p>
 
<p>- Be cautious about people whom you meet online. They may not be whom they claim to be.</p>

<p>Revealing personal details online is extremely risky. If you are a victim of any scam or fraud, please report it immediately to the Stanford University Department of Public Safety at (650) 329-2413 (24/7) or your local law enforcement agency.  </p>
