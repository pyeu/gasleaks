 <h3><a name=""></a><u>Sexual Battery Update 8/8/2014</u></h3>

<p>The follow up investigation of the sexual battery that was originally reported on 8/7/2014 has revealed additional information as follows: On Thursday, August 7, 2014, at about 6:17 p.m., deputies from the Stanford Department of Public Safety responded to a report of a sexual battery that had just occurred, reportedly near Nixon Elementary School at 1711 Stanford Avenue on the campus of Stanford University. Deputies responded immediately but were unable to locate the suspect. After conducting the initial investigation, the deputies determined that the crime actually occurred in the 2300 block of Amherst Street in Palo Alto.</p> 

<p>The investigation revealed that the victim, a woman in her fifties, was out for a walk. She initially observed the suspect walking his dog on California Avenue near Birch Street. When she was on California Avenue near Williams Street, the suspect walked up to her with his dog and engaged her in conversation. They walked together westbound on California Avenue for several blocks. The suspect began making inappropriate comments to the victim, and when they turned right onto Amherst Street, the suspect groped the womanâs buttocks and breast. When the victim took out her phone, the suspect fled in an unknown direction with his dog.</p> 

<p>The victim described the suspect as a white male in his mid-twenties, about 6 feet 4 inches tall and 220 pounds. He was wearing blue jeans and a light blue buttoned shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. He has short brown hair and a closely-groomed beard. He had a tattoo on his right forearm with writing on it. The suspectâs dog was a gray and blue pitbull with white spots on each paw. The victim estimated the dog was about 80 pounds.</p>

<p>Palo Alto and Stanford Detectives are actively investigating this incident. This case is not related to two other battery cases that occurred in the same area last month; police arrested the suspect in those two cases.</p> 

<p>Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call our 24-hour dispatch center at 650-329-2413.</p> 

<p>The Stanford Department of Public Safety urges community members to be alert and remain aware of their surroundings at all times. Call 911 immediately to report suspicious activity to the Stanford Police Department. Additional information will be posted at this website if it becomes available.</p>

<h3><a name=""></a><u>Reported Sexual Assault</u></h3>
<p>On May 7th, 2014, a Campus Security Authority notified the Stanford Police Department that a female student reported that she was sexually assaulted by a non-student male acquaintance in a vehicle parked near the intersection of Lomita and Santa Teresa the evening of May 5th, 2014. There was no alcohol involved in this situation.  </p>

<p>Stanford University does not tolerate sexual assault, sexual misconduct or sexual  harassment.The university encourages anyone who has been sexually assaulted or subject to other forms of sexual  misconduct or harassment to report the incident to university officials. </p>

<p>The information about this incident is being reported to you in accordance with the Clery Act. The remainder of this email provides information about preventing and reporting sexual assault.   
<ul>
<li>Ignorance of the law or of university policy concerning sexual assault, sexual  misconduct and sexual harassment is not a defense. 
<li>Receive affirmative consent from your partner before engaging in sexual activity.  
<li>Perpetrators may attempt to use alcohol to facilitate a sexual assault. Statistically, the majority of reported sexual  assaults occur while one or both parties are under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  Alcohol or drugs may impair one's ability to judge whether or not consent has been given, but it is never an excuse for choosing to violate another person.  
<li>There are a number of drugs that may be added to beverages with the intent of altering the consciousness or incapacitating a person without their knowledge. These drugs are particularly dangerous when combined with alcohol and often produce amnesia, leaving a victim unclear about what occurred afterward. These drugs can facilitate criminal activity, most often acts of sexual misconduct or sexual assault. 
</ul>
We encourage individuals to think about the following points to help protect yourself and others from consuming drinks that may have been tampered with harmful substances:
<ul>
<li>Do not accept previously prepared drinks, especially from persons that you do not know or intimately trust.  
<li>Drink from tamper-proof bottles and cans and insist on opening them.
<li>Insist on pouring or watching while any drink is mixed or prepared.
<li>Do not drink from group drinks such as punch bowls.
<li>Keep an eye on your drink or open soda can. Do not trust someone to watch it for you.
<li>If you think you've been drugged, do not be afraid to seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. There is a short window of time to ensure appropriate response and medical treatment in these cases and they could result in serious health complications and consequences.  
<li>If someone passes out or is exhibiting signs that they may have been given drugs, call for medical attention IMMEDIATELY and explain your concerns.  
<li>If you suspect that you or someone you know has been drugged, contact the Stanford Department of Public Safety or your Residence/Graduate Life Dean (or ask that someone do it for you) IMMEDIATELY.
</ul>
If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, or if you aren't sure whether you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, there are a number of resources available to you at Stanford to inform you of your options and to support you in whatever path you choose to take in addressing the incident.

<h3><a name=""></a><u>Community Alert: Bomb Threat Hoax</u></h3>

<p>Stanford is one of several locations across the country to have received intentional reports of non-existent emergencies.  Over the past week, Stanford Police received telephone calls in which the callers made vague allegations of having placed a bomb in an unspecified area of campus.  In one of the calls, laughter was heard in the background. Stanford Police quickly investigated each phone call and determined it not to be credible. The false reports appear to be part of a phenomenon known as "swatting," in which participants win "points" based upon the level of police response to a called-in hoax.</p>

<p>The Department of Public Safety wishes to emphasize the following points to the campus community about this matter.</p>
 
<p>First, intentionally reporting an emergency when none exists places the community at risk by diverting resources from real emergencies. </p> 

<p>Second, falsely reporting crimes or emergencies is a crime.  Stanford Police will conduct a thorough investigation of all such incidents. Offenders will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  In California, the law allows for the full cost recovery of an emergency response from the person perpetrating the hoax. The FBI and local law enforcement have successfully traced and prosecuted previous swatting incidents in various locations around the country.</p>

<p>Third, members of the campus community should not hesitate to call 911 or activate the nearest blue emergency tower to report crimes in progress or suspicious activity that you believe warrants a police response.  Additionally, practice your safety skills by remaining aware of your surroundings and being on the lookout for suspicious activity.  Report any suspicious activity or packages immediately by calling 911 or 9-911 from a campus telephone.  Stanford Police will use the AlertSU system to communicate with the campus community whenever there is a credible threat to personal safety.

<h2><a name=""></a><u>Update to Unauthorized Entry; Occupied Residence </u></h2>

<p>As reported in a prior AlertSU email, an unknown intruder entered a residence at Lagunita Court on Sunday, Feb. 23, 2014, at approximately 3:45 a.m.  The intruder entered the residence through an unlocked door.   One of the residents confronted the intruder and ordered him to leave; the intruder complied and left. The intruder's intent in entering the residence was unknown at that time.</p>

<p>After further investigation, it has been determined that the person who allegedly trespassed into the residence is a Stanford student whose judgment and cognitive abilities were impaired by alcohol.  The matter has been referred to the Office of the Vice Provost for Student Affairs for follow-up.</p>

<p>As outlined in the Stanford University Student Alcohol Policy, our community expects that all students should understand the physical and behavioral effects of alcohol misuse, and should avoid such misuse themselves.  In addition, they are asked to do their part to ensure the safety of fellow students who they perceive to be engaged in reckless drinking behavior or to be suffering from its consequences.</p>

Statistically, the majority of reported sexual assaults occur while one or both parties are under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  Alcohol or drugs may impair oneâs ability to judge whether or not consent has been given, but it is never an excuse for choosing to violate another person.</li> 

<li>There are a number of drugs that may be added to beverages with the intent of altering the consciousness or incapacitating a person without their knowledge. These drugs are particularly dangerous when combined with alcohol and often produce amnesia, leaving a victim unclear about what occurred afterward. These drugs can facilitate criminal activity; most often acts of sexual misconduct or sexual assault.</li> 
</ul>
<p>We encourage individuals to think about the following points to help protect yourself and others from consuming drinks that may have been tampered with harmful substances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not accept previously prepared drinks, especially from persons that you do not know or intimately trust.</li>  
<li>Drink from tamper-proof bottles and cans and insist on opening them.</li>
<li>Insist on pouring or watching while any drink is mixed or prepared.</li>
<li>Do not drink from group drinks such as punch bowls.</li>
<li>Keep an eye on your drink or open soda can. Do not trust someone to watch it for you.</li>
<li>If you think you've been drugged, do not be afraid to seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. There is a short window of time to ensure appropriate response and medical treatment in these cases and they could result in serious health complications and consequences.</li>  
<li>If someone passes out or is exhibiting signs that they may have been given drugs, call for medical attention IMMEDIATELY and explain your concerns.</li>  
<li>If you suspect that you or someone you know has been drugged, contact the Stanford Department of Public Safety or your Residence/Graduate Life Dean (or ask that someone do it for you) IMMEDIATELY.</li> 
</ul>
<p>If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, or if you arenât sure whether you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, there are a number of resources available to you at Stanford to inform you of your options and to support you in whatever path you choose to take in addressing the incident.

 <h3><a name=""></a><u>Bicycle-Riding Purse Snatch</u></h3>

<p>Police are searching for a bicycle-riding purse snatcher who committed two crimes within fifteen minutes last night in and near downtown Palo Alto. There were no injuries and the suspect remains at large.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, January 29, 2014, at about 6:54 p.m., the 24-hour dispatch center received a 9-1-1 call reporting that a suspect had just stolen a womanâs purse in the 400 block of University Avenue. The victim, a woman in her sixties, had been dining at an outdoor sidewalk table of a restaurant. She had placed her purse under the table. The suspect walked up and said, âExcuse me.â He reached down, grabbed her purse, and ran eastbound on University Avenue before getting onto a dark-colored bicycle. The victim called out for help, and a passerby gave chase on foot. The passerby last saw the suspect riding eastbound on Lytton Avenue from Cowper Street. The victim was not injured.</p>
<p>At about 7:32 p.m., police received a call reporting a strong-arm robbery attempt that had occurred around 6:45 p.m. at a bus stop on Quarry Road near Palo Road. The victim, a woman in her sixties, was standing at the bus stop when the suspect approached her on a bicycle. He tried to take her purse off her shoulder as he rode by, but the victim held onto the purse. They both struggled over the purse for a brief moment, but the victim was able to keep it. The suspect rode away westbound on Quarry Road, and was last seen heading south towards Palm Drive on either Sweet Olive Way or Arboretum Road. The victim was not injured, and returned home to call police.</p>
<p>Despite an extensive area search after both crimes, officers could not find the suspect.</p>
<p>The victims provided similar descriptions of the suspect. They described him as a male (described as possibly white, Hispanic, or Asian) in his late teens or early twenties, between 6 feet and 6 feet 3 inches tall, with a thin build. They said he was clean-shaven. He was wearing a black jacket and blue jeans, and may have been wearing a white hat. They said his bicycle was dark in color, and may have had whitewall tires. It is possible
that the victims may be able to meet with a police sketch artist; if a sketch is produced, it will be released as soon as it becomes available.</p>
<p>Detectives do not know if the suspect intentionally targeted these victims due to their age, or if he targeted them due to the circumstances and opportunities unique to each case.</p>
<p>Police recommend that you remain aware of your surroundings at all times, and we ask that you report suspicious behavior immediately via 9-1-1. Purses should be worn close to the body, with a firm grip kept on them, to dissuade would-be robbers.</p>
<p>Anyone with information about either of these crimes is asked to call the 24-hour dispatch center at 650-329-2413.</p>

<h3><a name="fall13"></a><u>Community Crime Alert</u></h3>

<p>A student reported experiencing a loss of memory after consuming a drink that had been provided by a person not known to the student.  The incident occurred on November 1, 2013 at an on-campus fraternity party.  The person who provided the drink is described as a tall, burly white male with facial hair and dressed in a plaid shirt.  According to the reporting party, it is possible that a sexual assault or some form of sexual misconduct may have occurred while the student was under the influence of alcohol and / or another unknown intoxicant.</p>

<p>Engaging in any type of sexual behavior when the involved persons are unable to knowingly and willingly give consent is not acceptable behavior and could even constitute a crime.  Because some persons will take advantage of others, students (and others) are advised not to accept beverages from people who are not known to them and to maintain possession of items which you intend to consume.  To ensure the safety of your peers, students are urged to intervene when risky behavior is observed or suspected.  </p>

<p>Students who have been sexually assaulted are strongly encouraged to seek assistance from professional resources.  Additionally, the assault should be reported to the SARA Office and to the police in a timely manner.</p>

<h3><a name=""></a><u>Community Crime Alert</u></h3>

<p>There have been numerous thefts and burglaries from vehicles, offices, and buildings in the greater Menlo Park/Palo Alto area over the past several months.  In September 2013, there were 61 reported vehicle burglaries in the city of Palo Alto, the highest number for a single month since 2008.  Many of the burglaries have occurred in parking lots, parking structures, and on residential streets within close proximity to the Stanford campus.  The Stanford campus is not currently experiencing the same level of thefts and auto burglaries as our neighbors, but members of the Stanford community have had laptops, smart phones, and personal electronic devices stolen from them both on and off-campus.  </p>

<p>To help prevent Stanford from becoming the next target of opportunity for a rash of burglaries, the Stanford University Department of Public Safety is encouraging individuals to engage in a few simple practices:</P>
<ul>
<li>Do not leave valuables inside a vehicle or unattended on your desk or work area.    
<li>Lock your vehicle every time it is not occupied.  Keep your office and rooms locked, even if you are only going to be away for a few minutes.  If you do not have a door to your office, keep valuables locked in a drawer or cabinet when you are away from your desk.
<li>If your vehicle is equipped with an alarm system, activate it each time you leave the vehicle unattended.
<li>When possible, park in areas that are well-lighted.  
<li><u>Most importantly</u>, if you observe any suspicious activity or behavior such as an individual loitering around vehicles, peering into vehicles, and/or trying door handles, or wandering in an office area without legitimate business, call 9-1-1 immediately. 
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the university is encouraging individuals to encrypt their mobile devices.  Information about ways to best protect your mobile devices can be found at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/security/securecomputing/"><u> http://www.stanford.edu/group/security/securecomputing/</u></a> </p>

<p>If you do become the victim of a crime, please report it immediately to the local law enforcement jurisdiction.  If the property which has been stolen contains sensitive or confidential data, report the theft immediately to the universityâs Privacy Office at (650) 725-1828 or <a href="mailto:privacy@stanford.edu">privacy@stanford.edu.</a>  </p>

<p>If you have any questions, concerns, or would like additional information about crime prevention, please call the Department of Public Safety at (650)723-9633.
