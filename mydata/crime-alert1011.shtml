<p><i><b>Community Crime Alerts</B> are reports of major criminal incidents on the campus that could potentially affect the larger Stanford community.  While such crimes are not indicative of life on campus, it is important to be aware of them when they do occur and to take the appropriate precautions.</i></p>

<p><i>The following crime alerts were put out by the Stanford University Department of Public Safety during the academic year of 2010-2011.  Crime Alerts are listed according to the most recent incident.</i></p>

<h3><a name=""></a><u>Suspicious Person</u></h3>

<p>On Wednesday June 1, 2011, a male subject attempted to contact two different female students at their residences -- Munger #4 and Xanadu. The subject was described as a 67 years old, white male standing 5'10 tall, weighing 140 lbs, with grayish brown hair, green eyes, a fair complexion and wearing glasses. </p>

<p>The subject had previously initiated conversations with both students at separate times and places. He was able to obtain each studentâs email address and days later emailed them. When they did not respond to his email, he attempted to locate them at their residences. No violence or criminal activity was associated with these contacts.</p>

<p>The subject is known to the Department of Public Safety. He has a history of posing as someone affiliated with Stanford University, most recently as a Stanford professor looking to hire students for paid internships. He targets female students; requesting email addresses and eventually trying to find out where the student lives. He is often accompanied by his elderly mother.</p>

<p>The subject was admonished by the Department of Public Safety not to enter student residences. If he is found inside a student residence contact SUDPS at 650-329-2413. </p>

<p>The Department of Public Safety would like to remind everyone to keep all doors secured and be cautious when sharing personal information with people whom you do not know.

<h3><a name="spring11"></a><u>Update to Shots Fired from 5/14/11</u></h3>

<p>On Saturday, May 14, 2011 at 7:17pm, as patrons were leaving a student sponsored event held on Roble Field of the Stanford campus, multiple gunshots were heard coming from the Lagunita parking lot, which is located across the street from Roble field.  </p>
<p> 
At this time, it is unknown if any of the gun shots were directed at an individual, but no injuries were reported at the time of the incident and no injuries have been reported since the incident.   Witnesses did observe an individual shoot several gun shots into the asphalt of the parking lot before getting into a vehicle with large wheels and flee the scene.   The handgun involved in this act was described by a witness as being black in color. </p>
<p>  
An officer responding to the scene observed a vehicle matching the description provided by witnesses of an involved vehicle, and attempted to stop the vehicle.   The vehicle failed to yield and a vehicle pursuit ensued.   During the pursuit, two passengers bailed from the vehicle and fled into the wooded area bordered by Campus Dr, Quarry Rd, Palm Drive and El Camino Real.   Police subsequently detained and questioned two individuals found in this area.  The fleeing vehicle, a white Lexus, was found abandoned in a parking lot and is in police custody.  </p>
<p>
A second vehicle has been identified as being involved in the incident.  Witnesses describe the second vehicle as an older, 2-door vehicle, possibly a Lexus or Buick, which is burnt orange, brown, or gold in color.  This vehicle has distinct, large rims (possibly 24 inches in diameter) and scissor-doors (doors that rotate vertically at a fixed hinge at the front of the door, rather than outwardly as with a conventional door).    The driver of the second vehicle was observed waving a handgun, possibly silver in color, out of the open window on the driver's side of the vehicle as he left the scene on Santa Teresa Street.   One witness described the driver waving the hand gun as a Black male wearing a baseball cap with a red brim. </p>  
<p>
Stanford Police are continuing to investigate this incident and ask that anyone with information please contact the Stanford Police at 650-329-2413.

<h3><a name=""></a><u>Robbery</u></h3>

<p><p>On Sunday, 04/24/11 at around 3:50 AM, a graduate student awoke to find an intruder in the living room of his apartment at the Munger Graduate Residence. The victim confronted the suspect, who then fled the residence with a suitcase filled with the victim's property. A man matching the suspect's description was spotted walking on Galvez Street near the Stanford Stadium a short time after the robbery. Before police could contact him, he disappeared into the groves. A few minutes later, an officer attempted to stop a black Dodge Charger on Arboretum Road near the location where the suspect had last been seen. Initially, the driver complied and stopped the vehicle, but then the vehicle sped away at a high rate of speed. The vehicle was last seen on Embarcadero Road heading toward Highway 101. It was occupied by several black males, some of whom may have had dreadlocks.

<p>The victim's suitcase was later recovered in the groves with his property still in it along with several other electronic items that did not belong to the victim.

<p>The suspect was described by the victim as a black male in his mid-twenties, with a dark complexion and short black hair (as viewed from the front). He stood about 5'2 to 5'4 and had a chubby build. The suspect most likely entered the apartment through an unlocked door. Anyone with information about this crime is encouraged to contact the Stanford Police at 650-329-2413. Stanford Police remind people to take simple preventative measures - such as locking doors and windows, not propping open exterior doors - to help prevent criminal activity.</p></p>

 <h3><a name=""></a><u>Update  to Sexual Assault From 4/09/11</u></h3>

<p>As previously reported, on Saturday, 04/09/11 at approximately
9:40pm, an unidentified male suspect entered an apartment on the
Stanford campus and sexually assaulted a female student who had been
sleeping in her bedroom.  The suspect tried to hold the victim down
as he assaulted her.  She resisted the assailant's attack, and he
fled from the apartment.  Shortly after the assault, a K-9 from the
Palo Alto Police Department tracked a scent from the apartment to the
area of El Camino and Churchill St in Palo Alto, but the suspect was
not located.   The point of entry in to the apartment may have been
an unlocked door.

<p>The victim initially described the suspect as a dark skinned male,
possibly Black, around 30 years of age. Upon further reflection and
discussion, the victim believes the suspect is more likely to be
Asian Indian.  The suspect description now stands as follows:

<p>Dark skinned male, possibly Asian Indian, approximately 30 years of
age.  He stands 5'6" in height and has a chubby build.  He has short,
wavy black hair and a rounded nose.  The suspect was last seen
wearing jeans and a dark t-shirt.  The victim remembers smelling
scent similar to apples at the time of the attack.

<p>Anyone with information about this crime is urged to call the
Stanford Department of Public Safety at 650-723-9633 or 650-329-2413.

<h3><a name="winter11"></a><u>Mountain Lion Precaution</u></h3>
