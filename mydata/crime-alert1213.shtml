 <h3><a name=""></a><u>Robbery 08/16/13</u></h3>

<p>The Stanford Department of Public Safety was notified today, Tuesday, August 20, that a robbery occurred last Friday, August 16, 2013 in the Wilbur Hall parking lot. The female victim reported that on Friday night, at approximately 11:15p.m., she was walking from Green Library through the Wilbur Hall parking lot when she was approached by two men. One of the men physically restrained her and threatened physical harm if she did not comply. Fearing for her safety, she emptied her pockets as instructed. The suspect who restrained her also forcibly took her backpack from her. The suspects stole her laptop, two cell phones, and other personal property. The victim described the suspects as follows:</p>  
<p>SUSPECT #1 </P>
<p>Black male, 27-30 years of age; 6â tall with a muscular build; last seen wearing: black t-shirt and a rough-textured leather jacket.</p> 
<p>SUSPECT #2 </p>
<p>Black male, 22-25 years of age; 5â9â tall with a slim build; last seen wearing: blue New York Yankees âhoodieâ and loose jeans. </p>  
<p>The Stanford Department of Public Safety is currently investigating this matter. If you have additional information about this incident, please contact the Stanford Department of Public Safety at 650-329-2413. </p>
<p>DPS encourages you to be vigilant about your surroundings when walking in public. Please report suspicious activity immediately by calling 911. Be aware of the locations of the Emergency Blue Tower phones that are located throughout campus. They connect directly to 911 and can be used to report emergencies and suspicious behavior. </p>
</p>http://maps.stanford.edu/sites/all/lbres-shared/files/maps/files/shared/file/maps_records/Suggested_Travel_Routes_Map.pdf </p> 
<p>Additional information about this incident will be posted on the Stanford Department of Public Safety website ( police.stanford.edu ) as it becomes available. </p>

<h3><a name=""></a><u>Phone Scam 8/08/13</u></h3>

<p>Several victims have reported a phone scam.  A male SUSPECT is calling and telling the Victim he/she did not respond properly to a jury duty notice, so there is a current warrant out for their arrest. The SUSPECT, who claims to be a law enforcement official, asks for credit card and debit card information, including the PIN number.  NO Law Enforcement Agency would ever do this under any circumstance.  Please DO NOT give out any credit card or debit card information over the phone to anyone, EVER! If you receive a similar call, please note the incoming phone number, hang up on the person and call Stanford DPS immediately.  </p></p>

<h3><a name=""></a><u>Palo Alto Robberies, 5/13/13 and 5/15/13</u></h3>

<p>Stanford Police would like to make the community aware of recent robberies in neighboring downtown Palo Alto: </p>  
<p><b><i>From Palo Alto PD</i></b> -- On Tuesday, May 14, 2013, at about 11:17 a.m., the Palo Alto 24-hour dispatch center received a report of a robbery that had occurred the night before around 10:45 pm on Monday, May 13, 2013. </p>

<p>The investigation revealed that the victim, a woman in her twenties who is an employee of a downtown business, had been walking westbound on the north sidewalk of the 200 block of Hamilton Avenue.  As she crossed the alleyway named Lane 12 West (which is located mid-block between Ramona Street and Emerson Street), a man grabbed her ponytail and pulled her backwards into the alley.  As he held her hair, he demanded money.  She gave him money out of her purse, at which point he released her hair and ran away northbound through the alley.  The victim filed the report with police the following morning.</p>

<p>The victim never saw the suspect, and could only describe him as a male who was taller than 5 feet 5 inches tall.  She said the suspect had a deep, raspy voice with no accent.</p>

<p>Then on Wednesday, May 15, 2013, at about 9:57 p.m., the Palo Alto 24-hour dispatch center received a call of an attempted robbery that had just occurred in the 700 block of Emerson Street.  Two men, one of whom was armed with a handgun, attempted to rob three women walking together in downtown Palo Alto last night.  The women fled on foot and no property was taken.</p>

<p>The investigation revealed that the victims (one in her thirties, one in her forties, and one in her fifties) were walking together northbound on the west side of the 700 block of Emerson Street.  Two men stepped out from an alcove of a business.  One of them pointed a gun at the women and demanded their property.  The victims immediately separated and ran in different directions, each going to a nearby open business and asking for help to call police.  The suspects did not pursue them, and instead were last seen running together southbound on Emerson Street towards Homer Avenue.  Officers arrived on scene immediately, but were not able to locate any suspects.</p>

<p>The victims described the first suspect as a Hispanic male in his twenties, between 5 feet 3 inches and 5 feet 6 inches tall.  He had a medium build, and was wearing dark clothing and a covering over his face.  He was armed with a small black handgun.  The victims could only describe the second suspect as a "tall" male with a blue bandanna covering his face.  No suspect sketches will be forthcoming.</p>

<p>Detectives are investigating both of these incidents, including any possible connections between the two.  Officers are increasing patrols in the downtown area.</p>

<p>Anyone with information about either robbery can contact the Palo Alto 24-hour dispatch center at 650-329-2413.  Anonymous tips can be e-mailed to <a href="mailto:paloalto@tipnow.org?Subject=Palo%20Alto%20Robberies%20">paloalto@tipnow.org</a> or sent via text message or voice mail to 650-383-8984. </p> 

<p>We continue to recommend that you remain aware of your surroundings when out in public, and we encourage you to report suspicious behavior immediately via 9-1-1.</p>

<h3><a name=""></a><u>Community Crime Alert: 4/13/13 Provident Credit Union Robbery</u></h3>

<p>Palo Alto, CA -- A man entered Provident Credit Union in Palo Alto on Saturday morning and robbed the business of an undisclosed amount of cash.</p> 

<p>On Saturday, April 13, 2013, at about 9:05 a.m., our 24-hour dispatch center received a 9-1-1 call from Provident Credit Union at 2390 El Camino Real reporting the business had just been robbed. Officers arrived on scene within a minute, but were unable to locate the suspect. No one was injured during the robbery.</p> 

<p>The investigation revealed that the suspect entered the credit union and presented a note to the tellers demanding money. The note claimed the suspect had a firearm, though one was never seen. The tellers complied with his demand. The suspect fled on foot, running southbound through the parking lot just west of the credit union. A witness said they saw the suspect driving away in a silver or gray 2-door sedan, possibly a Ford Thunderbird, headed southbound on El Camino Real.</p> 

<p>Witnesses described the suspect as a black male in his forties or fifties, between 5 feet 9 inches and 6 feet 1 inch tall, with a thin build. He was wearing a black nylon jacket with a white and gray horizontal stripe across the chest, black nylon pants with a white stripe down the legs, a white wristwatch, and white shoes. He wore eyeglasses and a black baseball hat. He was carrying a black backpack. A Provident Credit Union surveillance photo of the suspect is attached to this release. It is possible that witnesses may be able to 
work with a police sketch artist to produce a sketch; if that occurs, the sketch will be released separately as soon as it is available.</p> 

<p>A suspect also robbed the same Provident Credit Union on January 9, 2013. That case has been solved, with charges currently pending against 32-year-old San Jose resident  Hunter D. Thompson. Details about that incident can be obtained in our press release archive at <a href="http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/gov/depts/pol/press.asp">http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/gov/depts/pol/press.asp</a>.</p> 

<p>Detectives are actively investigating Saturdayâs robbery. Anyone who recognizes the suspect or who may have information about this incident is asked to call our 24-hour dispatch center at 650-329-2413. Anonymous tips can be e-mailed to <a href="mailto:paloalto@tipnow.org?subject=Provident Credit Union Robbery">paloalto@tipnow.org</a> or sent via text message or voice mail to 650-383-8984.</p>

<h3><a name=""></a><u>Violence Prevention Resources & Response</u></h3>

<p>In light of this morningâs tragic events at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Stanford Public Safety encourages the community to review the Universityâs violence prevention and response resources:</p>

<p>One of the keys to preventing violent situations is to <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/SUDPS/threat-assessment/warning-signs.shtml"><b>recognize potential threats</b></a> and <b>take early action</b> to provide troubled individuals with the help they need.  Visit <a href="http://safety.stanford.edu"><b>http://safety.stanford.edu</b></a> to explore a variety of resources, including counseling services available for: <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/SUDPS/threat-assessment/faculty-staff.shtml"><b>Faculty & Staff</b></a> and <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/SUDPS/threat-assessment/students.shtml"><b>Students</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Immediately dial 911</b> (9-911 from a campus phone, or activate an emergency blue tower) if you are in a situation you feel could become violent or have witnessed a violent event.</p>

<p><b>Review the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/EHS/prod/general/erprep/EmerGuide/EmerGuide_Oct_2011.html">Emergency Guide</a></b> for direction on how to react to an active threat. Your goal should always be to escape a violent situation but if that isnât possible, then place solid objects between you and the threat. Walls are not always as solid as they appear so keep in mind that there is a difference between concealment and cover. Concealment is, as the name implies, hiding, while âcoverâ is something that actually provides you with a measure of protection.</p>

<p><b>Public Safety personnel are available to meet with your department to present a one and a half hour seminar</b> on how to respond to an active threat.  To request this training, please call 650-736-9669 or email <a href="mailto:community-outreach@lists.stanford.edu?subject=Active Threat Presentation">community-outreach@lists.stanford.edu</a>.</p>
 
<p><b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VcSwejU2D0">Watch the âRun. Hide. Fight.â video</b></a> developed by Ready Houston in partnership with the US Department of Homeland Security.  This six minute video provides basic information on what you can do to survive an active shooter event.</p>

<p>Please direct any questions to Public Safety at 650-723-9633 or the Stanford Office of Emergency Management at 650-723-0448.</p>

<h3><a name=""></a><u><i>Update to</i> 11/29/12 Shot Fired</u></h3>

<p>This morning the Department of Public Safety issued a text and email AlertSU message to alert the Stanford community of a firearm discharge in the grove adjacent to the intersection of Quarry Road and Campus Drive West, near the Stanford Hospital.</p>

<p>At the time the alert was issued, police officials had not firmly established the nature of the incident.  Since then it has been confirmed that the single shot fired was an attempted suicide by a male subject in his 50s, with no known Stanford affiliation.  The individual was injured and hospitalized.  No one else was involved or harmed.</p>

<p>In the wake of this unfortunate incident and during this especially stressful time in the quarter, Stanford reminds the campus community to be attentive to their well-being and that of those around them, and utilize the services and support of the following resources:</p>

<p><b><u>Students</u></b></p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Vaden Health Center</b> (650) 723-3785 offers 24-hour crisis counseling and a range of other services for students</p></li>

<h3><a name="fall12"></a><u><i>Additional Information for</i> Sexual Battery, 9/19/12, 6:53 am</u></h3>

<p><i><b>From Palo Alto PD</i></b> -- Early this morning, a female jogger was able to free herself from a man who approached her from behind and bear-hugged her, grabbing her breast in the process and possibly trying to pull her down.  Police believe the suspect is likely the same person who has committed two recent sexual batteries in Palo Alto.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, September 19, 2012, at about 6:53 a.m., officers from the Palo Alto Police Department responded to the area of Palo Alto Avenue at Alma Street on a report of an assault that had just occurred.  The victim, a female in her 20s, was jogging southbound into Palo Alto from Menlo Park on the path through El Palo Alto Park at 102 Palo Alto Avenue.  An unknown male suspect approached her from behind, bear-hugged her, and grabbed one of her breasts.  The victim said she felt as though the suspect was trying to pull her down.  She screamed.  She was able to wriggle free from his grasp, and in the process, she fell to the ground.  The suspect immediately jogged away from her on the same path and headed southbound on the sidewalk of Alma Street.  The victim did not suffer any injuries.</p>

<p>The victim followed the suspect from a distance and used her cell phone to call the police.  She yelled after the suspect and told him she was notifying police.  She last saw the suspect jogging eastbound on Hawthorne Avenue from Alma Street.</p>

<p>Several officers and detectives from the Palo Alto Police Department responded to the area, as did a police canine unit from the Menlo Park Police Department.  Officers extensively checked the area with the police dog, but were unable to locate the suspect.</p>

<p>The victim described the suspect as possibly Middle Eastern or Hispanic, about 40 years of age.  He was about 5 feet 9 inches tall with a medium build.  The victim said he was dressed as though he too was out for a jog, as he was wearing a light gray long-sleeve shirt and dark gray or black running pants.  He had thin black hair.  As the victim was never able to see the details of the suspect's face, there is no sketch available for distribution.</p>

<p>This appears to be the third crime likely committed by the same suspect in Palo Alto in the past month.  On August 20, the suspect grabbed a womanâs buttocks in the 600 block of Fulton Street at about noon.  On August 29, the suspect grabbed a womanâs breast at the Stanford Shopping Center at about 12:13 p.m.  Sketches of the suspect from both of those cases have been previously released, and are available on our Facebook page at www.facebook.com/PaloAltoPolice.</p>  

<p>Investigators do not believe that a sexual battery that occurred on the Stanford University campus on September 12 is related to this series of incidents in Palo Alto, as the suspect description is different.</p>

<p>Detectives from the Palo Alto Police Department are actively investigating these incidents.  Any developments or any new suspect information will be released to the community in a timely manner.</p>

<p>"We are concerned about all of these events, but we are particularly concerned about this one, as it appears as though the suspectâs behavior may be escalating," said Lieutenant Zach Perron.  âWeâre going to do everything we can to identify and apprehend him.  We ask for the publicâs help with reporting suspicious behavior immediately to 9-1-1.â</p>

<p>While this has been the only case of a female jogger being targeted, we recommend that women jog in pairs or small groups whenever possible.  In every case, however, we strongly recommended that joggers not cover both ears with headphones, so as to be better aware of their surroundings and anyone who may be approaching them from behind.  We also recommend that joggers carry a cell phone with them, and stay in well-traveled areas whenever possible.</p>

<p>There are a number of good personal safety and crime prevention tips posted on the City of Palo Alto website.  Visit <a href="http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/StopCrime">www.cityofpaloalto.org/StopCrime</a> for more information.</p>

<p>We continue to recommend that you remain aware of your surroundings when out in public, and we encourage you to report suspicious behavior immediately via 9-1-1.  Anyone with information about this incident or the other recent sexual batteries is asked to call our 24-hour dispatch center at 650-329-2413.

<h3><a name=""></a><u>9/7/12 Auto Burglars Strike Palo Alto Parking Lots and Parking Garages</u></h3>

<p><b>Palo Alto, CA</b> -- Officers from the Palo Alto Police Department have taken 17 auto burglary reports in the past two days. In all 17 vehicles, the windows were smashed and the suspects stole computer bags, laptops, electronic equipment and personal documents.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, September 5, 2012, there were a total of 11 reported auto burglaries. The suspects targeted vehicles clustered in the same location within a downtown parking lot or the Stanford Shopping Center parking lot.</p>

<p>At the Stanford Shopping Center, the suspects burglarized six vehicles within a ten minute time frame, from 8:00 â 8:10 p.m. All six vehicles were locked and parked in the same general area on the west side, along El Camino Real. In all of these cases, the suspect smashed a window, reached inside, and pulled the trunk release lever. The suspect then stole laptop bags containing computers and other personal items that were in the trunk.</p>

<p>At approximately 8:42 p.m., our 24-hour dispatch center received a report of an auto burglary in City Parking Garage âRâ at 528 High Street. Officers from the Palo Alto Police Department responded and discovered a total of four vehicles had been burglarized. The suspect smashed a window out in each vehicle and reached inside to retrieve laptop bags and brief cases containing computers, electronic items, and other personal documents. Items were taken from the interior compartment in three of the four burglaries. The suspect pulled the trunk release lever on the fourth vehicle and stole items from there.</p> 

<p>At 9:17 p.m., one final victim reported an auto burglary in City Parking Lot âHâ at 571 Cowper Street. Again, the suspect smashed a window and reached inside the main cabin to retrieve two laptop bags containing computers and personal items.</p> 

<p>On Thursday, September 6, 2012, there were a total of six reported auto burglaries reported from three separate downtown parking garages.</p>

<p>Between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. two auto burglaries occurred in City Parking Garage âRâ at 528 High Street. The suspect smashed a window in both cases. In one case, the suspect stole a backpack containing personal items that was in plain view. The suspect pulled the trunk release in the second vehicle and stole a laptop from the trunk.</p>

<p>Between the hours of 7:00 and 9:30 p.m., two auto burglaries occurred in City Parking Garage âSâ at 445 Bryant Street. The suspect smashed a window in each of the two vehicles and removed laptop bags that were in plain view.</p>

<p>The last two reported auto burglaries occurred between 7:30 and 9:45 p.m. in City Parking Garage âJâ at 520 Webster Street. Again, the suspect smashed a window out in each vehicle and removed a laptop bag and backpack that were in plain view.</p>

<p>Although a handful of the victim vehicles were rental cars, it does not appear that the suspect targeted any particular make or model. It appears as though the suspects could be targeting rental vehicles, perhaps with the thinking that business travelers often travel with personal electronic devices.</p>

<p>We recommend that you take your valuables with you whenever possible, or at the very least, secure them out of sight prior to arriving at your destination. Leaving valuables in plain view is a sure way to attract the attention of a burglar. Also, be sure to always lock your vehicle and close the windows when it is unattended. While that advice would not have helped the victims in these cases, having a locked vehicle will absolutely have a deterrent effect on some criminals. For more crime prevention tips, please visit our website at <a href="http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/StopCrime">www.cityofpaloalto.org/StopCrime</a>.</p>

<p>Officers and detectives from the Palo Alto Police Department are actively working this crime trend. Uniformed officers are increasing their patrols, and plainclothes detectives are also out looking for the suspects.</p>

<p>In a few of the cases, witnesses observed possible suspects. However, the possible suspect descriptions are so varied that the Palo Alto Police Department is not releasing any information about them at this time, and instead would like to ask people to focus on observing suspicious behavior, as opposed to looking for a particular description of person. Detectives believe that the 17 cases are likely related, and were committed by the same suspect or group of suspects.</p>

<p>We encourage people to call 9-1-1 to report suspicious behavior, and allow the police to investigate if that behavior is innocent or criminal. It is always better to call and let the police do their job, rather than rationalize suspicious behavior and not call. For example, people loitering in parking lots and peering into cars or trying door handles is absolutely suspicious behavior, and merits a 9-1-1 call right away. Anyone with information about these auto burglaries is asked to call our 24-hour dispatch center at 650-329-2413. Anonymous tips can be e-mailed to paloalto@tipnow.org or sent via text message or voice mail to 650-383-8984.</p>

<h3><a name=""></a><u>8/29/12 Sexual Battery Occurs at Stanford Shopping Center</u></h3>

<p><p><b>Palo Alto, CA</b> -- A man approached a woman in the parking lot of Stanford Shopping
Center this afternoon, grabbed one of her breasts over her clothes, and fled on foot.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, August 29, 2012, at about 12:13 p.m., officers from the Palo Alto Police
Department responded to the Stanford Shopping Center at 180 El Camino Real on a report
of a sexual battery that had just occurred. The victim, a female in her 30s, was walking
eastbound on the sidewalk of Orchard Lane between Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus. An
unknown male suspect stepped out in front of her from between two parked cars and used
his hand to grab one of the victimâs breasts over her clothing. The suspect then ran away
and was last seen in a parking lot along Welch Road. The victim immediately called 9-1-1
from her cell phone. Officers and detectives from the Palo Alto Police Department,
assisted by deputies from the Stanford Department of Public Safety, conducted an
extensive search but could not find the suspect. The victim was not injured.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/SexualBattery_Sus_082912.jpg" /></p>

<p>The victim described the suspect as an East Indian male, about 30 years of age. He was
wearing a yellow hooded sweatshirt with the hood up over his head. The victim said he
was about 5 feet 9 inches tall with a medium build. A sketch of the suspect is attached to
this press release.</p>

<p>There was a similar sexual battery reported to us last week. The press release and sketch
from that case are attached here for reference. Detectives are actively investigating these
cases, and believe it is likely the same suspect may be responsible for both crimes. Patrol
officers and plainclothes detectives will be on the lookout for the suspect in the meantime.</p>
