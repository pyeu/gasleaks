<p>At around 5:15pm Friday evening, 8/14/15, after officers from the Stanford Department of Public Safety and the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office concluded their search of the facilities and determined there was no threat, all buildings in the Knight Management Center complex reopened.  </p>
<p> Police thank members of the campus community for their cooperation.</p>
<p>The Department of Public Safety encourages community members to be alert to your surroundings and to report any suspicious activity or packages to police by calling 911. </p> <p> Any persons with information about the bomb threat are urged to call the Stanford Department of Public Safety at 650-723-9633.</a></p>

 <h3><a name=""></a><u>Mountain Lion Sighting 07/29/2015</u></h3>

<p>A mountain lion was seen in the vicinity of Santa Ynez and Mayfield at approximately 12:10am. Public Safety has searched the area and there have been no additional sightings reported. If you see a mountain lion do not approach it, especially one that is feeding or with cubs. Most mountain lions will try to avoid confrontation. Call 911. If you encounter a mountain lion, do not run; instead, face the animal, make noise and try to look bigger by waving your arms; throw rocks or other objects. For more information about mountain lions go to www.keepmewild.org.</p>

<h3><a name=""></a><u>Update on Dinkelspiel Auditorium Area</u></h3>

<p>Stanford Police ask members of the campus community to be on the lookout for the man below who was reported to have been near Dinkelspiel Auditorium on Tuesday evening with what a witness believed to be a gun.</P>

<p>A person approximately 50 feet away reported seeing this man standing and drinking from a green bottle, with what appeared to be a black handgun nearby on the ground, just after 8 p.m. Tuesday, July 28. When deputies arrived to investigate, neither the subject nor a gun could be located. There have been no additional reports of an armed individual.
</p>

<p>As a precautionary measure, Stanford Police ask the Stanford community to be on the lookout for anyone matching the subjectâs description. He was described as a white male in his 30s with short, dark brown hair; a clean-shaven face; and a distinctively large nose and bulging eyes. He was reported to be wearing khaki shorts and a T-shirt of an unknown color.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/sketch_72815.jpg" /></p>
<p>
Please be aware of your surroundings and call 911 if you see this individual or anyone else carrying a gun. Additional updates are not expected unless further information is obtained that indicates an ongoing threat to the community. </p>

<ul>
<li>Do not leave valuables inside a vehicle or unattended on your desk or work area.  
<li>If your vehicle is equipped with an alarm system, activate it each time you leave the vehicle unattended.
<li><u><b>Most importantly</u></b>, if you observe any suspicious activity or behavior such as an individual loitering around vehicles, peering into vehicles, and/or trying door handles, or wandering in an office area without legitimate business, call 9-1-1 immediately.
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the university is encouraging individuals to encrypt their mobile devices.  Information about ways to best protect your mobile devices can be found at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/security/securecomputing/"><u> http://www.stanford.edu/group/security/securecomputing/</u></a> </p>
<p>If you do become the victim of a crime, please report it immediately to the local law enforcement jurisdiction.

<h3><a name="winter15"></a><u>Community Alert:  FBI Public Service Announcements </u></h3>

<p>The FBI has recently issued two public service announcements regarding scams which have resulted in victims throughout the country.</p>  
<p>The first scam is known as the "Work-from-home" scam, which specifically targets university students.  Students have received emails recruiting them for payroll and/or human resource positions with fictitious companies.  The "position" requires the student to provide his/her bank account number under the guise of setting up direct deposit for his/her pay. </p>
<p>The second scam is a university employee payroll scam.  The employees are receiving fraudulent emails indicating a change in their human resource status.  The email contains a link directing the employee to login to their human resources website to identify this change.  While the website looks very similar to the legitimate site, it is actually a bogus site where the scammers are able to steal the employee's credentials.  The scammers then use these credentials to access the employee's direct deposit information via the actual website, redirecting their pay.  </p>

 <h3><a name=""></a><u>Reported Sexual Assault</u></h3>

<p>On November 17, 2014, a Campus Security Authority reported to the department of Public Safety that a female student had been sexually assaulted.  The location, date and time of the incident are unknown at this time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stanford University does not tolerate sexual assault, sexual misconduct or sexual harassment. The university encourages anyone who has been sexually assaulted or subject to other forms of sexual misconduct or harassment to report the incident to university officials. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The information about this incident is being reported to you in accordance with the Clery Act. The remainder of this email provides information about preventing and reporting sexual assault. </p>
<ul>
<li>Ignorance of the law or of university policy concerning sexual assault, sexual  misconduct and sexual harassment is not a defense.
<li>Receive affirmative consent from your partner before engaging in sexual activity.
<li>Perpetrators may attempt to use alcohol to facilitate a sexual assault. Statistically, the majority of reported sexual  assaults occur while one or both parties are under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  Alcohol or drugs may impair one's ability to judge whether or not consent has been given, but it is never an excuse for choosing to violate another person.
<li>There are a number of drugs that may be added to beverages with the intent of altering the consciousness or incapacitating a person without their knowledge. These drugs are particularly dangerous when combined with alcohol and often produce amnesia, leaving a victim unclear about what occurred afterward. These drugs can facilitate criminal activity, most often acts of sexual misconduct or sexual assault.
</ul>
<p>If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, or if you aren't sure whether you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, there are a number of resources available to you at Stanford to inform you of your options and to support you in whatever path you choose to take in addressing the incident.

<h3><a name="fall14"></a><u>Reported Sexual Assault 10/26/14</u></h3>

<p>From Stanford PD, on 10/26/14 at approximately 5:10am Sunday morning Stanford Police responded to a call at Page Mill and Hansen from a distressed Stanford Student. The student reported that she may have been drugged and sexually assaulted. The location and time of the reported incident are unknown at this time. 

<p>Stanford University does not tolerate sexual assault, sexual misconduct or sexual  harassment.The university encourages anyone who has been sexually assaulted or subject to other forms of sexual  misconduct or harassment to report the incident to university officials. </p>


<p>The information about this incident is being reported to you in accordance with the Clery Act. The remainder of this email provides information about preventing and reporting sexual assault.
<ul>
<li>Ignorance of the law or of university policy concerning sexual assault, sexual  misconduct and sexual harassment is not a defense.
<li>Receive affirmative consent from your partner before engaging in sexual activity.
<li>Perpetrators may attempt to use alcohol to facilitate a sexual assault. Statistically, the majority of reported sexual  assaults occur while one or both parties are under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  Alcohol or drugs may impair one's ability to judge whether or not consent has been given, but it is never an excuse for choosing to violate another person.
<li>There are a number of drugs that may be added to beverages with the intent of altering the consciousness or incapacitating a person without their knowledge. These drugs are particularly dangerous when combined with alcohol and often produce amnesia, leaving a victim unclear about what occurred afterward. These drugs can facilitate criminal activity, most often acts of sexual misconduct or sexual assault.
</ul>
We encourage individuals to think about the following points to help protect yourself and others from consuming drinks that may have been tampered with harmful substances:
<ul>
<li>Do not accept previously prepared drinks, especially from persons that you do not know or intimately trust.
<li>Drink from tamper-proof bottles and cans and insist on opening them.
<li>Insist on pouring or watching while any drink is mixed or prepared.
<li>Do not drink from group drinks such as punch bowls.
<li>Keep an eye on your drink or open soda can. Do not trust someone to watch it for you.
<li>If you think you've been drugged, do not be afraid to seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. There is a short window of time to ensure appropriate response and medical treatment in these cases and they could result in serious health complications and consequences.
<li>If someone passes out or is exhibiting signs that they may have been given drugs, call for medical attention IMMEDIATELY and explain your concerns.
<li>If you suspect that you or someone you know has been drugged, contact the Stanford Department of Public Safety or your Residence/Graduate Life Dean (or ask that someone do it for you) IMMEDIATELY.
</ul>
If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, or if you aren't sure whether you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, there are a number of resources available to you at Stanford to inform you of your options and to support you in whatever path you choose to take in addressing the incident.
